                    <p>Identifying promising leads can be a gamble. Without effective use of data, you may end up wasting valuable time and resources presenting your products and services to those who will never make it to the closing stage.</p>
                    <p>Minimize the risk with Orion. Orion uses the data collected from your leads to accurately predict which potential buyers are most likely to make a purchase. Orion also identifies the customers most loyal to your brand, which ones may stray to the competition, and what drives your buyers’ behavior. Plus, all of the value scores assigned to your leads and customers will be updated in real time, immediately tracking new data from new leads. You’ll know which leads to chase and which customers to prioritize, without any uncertainty.</p>

                        <h1>HOW TO WORK WITH SERIAL METRICS</h1>
                        <p>Technology is most powerful when it’s easy to use. That’s why we’ve streamlined our process to make working with Serial Metrics truly effortless.</p>
                        <h2>Integrating Orion</h2>
                        <p>Integration simply requires loading our Java SDK, which scans your databases for relevant and predicatively valuable features.</p>

                        <h2>Learning About Users</h2>
                        <p>Next, our system develops a starting model based on the column variables taken straight from your database. Orion will build upon this foundation as it learns more from your data.</p>

                        <h2>Fine-tuning Predictions</h2>
                        <p>To make sure that our predictive models are as maximally effective, we hone the parameters of your starting model to minimize the occurrence of type-1 and type-2 statistical errors. Orion gives you only the most accurate, high quality results.</p>

                        <h2>Deploying Results</h2>
                        <p>The newly perfected model will deploy an API that simultaneously checks your database for new users and looks back at the data of old users to see if their preferences or activity has changed. Based on this new information, Orion assigns scores and puts them into a ‘propensity’ table. This table will give you a clear view of Orion’s findings and your most important data at a glance. After creating the table, Orion allows you to easily search it for matches.</p>
                        <p>For more information on how to make the most of your data with Orion, contact us today. Our team of friendly experts will be happy to guide you through the start-up process. You have the data: let Serial Metrics help you maximize your results.</p>

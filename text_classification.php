                    <p>Understanding the key content from large volumes of text can be critical for making smart business decisions, especially when it comes to sorting your content or determining how your customers respond to your brand. Wondering what your customers think of your latest product launch? Don’t comb through conversations manually.</p>
                    <p>Orion streamlines and automates this process by eliminating reliance on narrow keywords. Our system discovers the topics and attitudes in a block of text by noting how often different terms and phrases appear. Orion not only organizes text, it also delves deeper to more effectively categorize and describe closely related categories. The result is a report of categories and attitudes that allows you to take informed action.</p>

                        <h1>HOW TO WORK WITH SERIAL METRICS</h1>
                        <p>Technology is most powerful when it’s easy to use. That’s why we’ve streamlined our process to make working with Serial Metrics truly effortless.</p>
                        <h2>Integrating Orion</h2>
                        <p>Integration simply requires loading our Java SDK, which scans your databases for relevant and predicatively valuable features.</p>

                        <h2>Learning About Users</h2>
                        <p>Next, our system develops a starting model based on the column variables taken straight from your database. Orion will build upon this foundation as it learns more from your data.</p>

                        <h2>Fine-tuning Predictions</h2>
                        <p>To make sure that our predictive models are as maximally effective, we hone the parameters of your starting model to minimize the occurrence of type-1 and type-2 statistical errors. Orion gives you only the most accurate, high quality results.</p>

                        <h2>Deploying Results</h2>
                        <p>The newly perfected model will deploy an API that simultaneously checks your database for new users and looks back at the data of old users to see if their preferences or activity has changed. Based on this new information, Orion assigns scores and puts them into a ‘propensity’ table. This table will give you a clear view of Orion’s findings and your most important data at a glance. After creating the table, Orion allows you to easily search it for matches.</p>

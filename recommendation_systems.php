        <h1>Recommendation Systems -  Personalize Content Discovery</h1>

        <p>Recommend content, tailored specifically to the tastes and preferences of individual users.  Imagine
        visiting a site - your favorite music site, or shopping site, and the site offering just the product
        that you wanted, before you even thought of it.  Amazing, right?  Amazing, but completely possible.</p>

            <h1>HOW TO WORK WITH SERIAL METRICS</h1>

            <h2>Integrating Orion</h2>
            <p class="description">Integration requires loading our Java SDK, which scans your databases for relevant, and predicatively valuable features.</p>

            <h2>Learning About Users</h2>
            <p class="description">Our system will then develop an initial model from the column variables automatically mined from your database.</p>

            <h2>Fine-tuning Predictions</h2>
            <p class="description">To test the efficacy of the predictive models, Serial Metrics fine tunes model parameters to reduce type-1 and type-2 statistical errors.</p>

            <h2>Deploying Results</h2>
            <p class="description">The final model deploys as an API which monitors your database for new users, or changes to current user&rsquo;s tastes/behavior, and writes scores to a designated &lsquo;propensity&rsquo; table.</p>

            <p>All you need to do is query the propensity table for matches.</p>

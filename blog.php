					<h2>Machine Learning, Simulations, and the Transfer of Tacit vs. Explicit Knowledge</h2>
					<br> <h3>by: Amir Behbehani</h3>
					<br><br><br>
					<h2> A New Economy, but No New Jobs</h2>
					<p> Nearly six years after the 2008 Stock Market crash, we finally see financial markets stabilizing, and asset portfolios yielding favorable returns. But, what about those jobs? It seems the labor market has lagged behind the financial market with unemployment still at roughly 7%.  Still, there is no disputing the facts: the labor market has rebounded from the 10% unemployment rates we saw in 2010, and is ever so slowly again reaching full-employment, which is certainly a good thing. The economy as measured by GDP is growing at a comfortable, average 2.5% annual rate (2010-2014), during which time the unemployment rate has decreased by an annual rate of .51%.  Interestingly, though, while the unemployment rate is decreasing, the labor force participation rate is also decreasing, and at <i> significant</i> rates. In fact, if the labor force participation rate were held constant from 2008 to 2014, the unemployment rate today would be 11.3%, higher than the 10% unemployment rate we saw in 2008.  Why are people leaving the labor force?  Where are they going? For the unemployment rate to keep from rising, GDP must grow by at least 2%, annually. At current GDP growth rates, unemployment figures will continue increasing unless some game-changing, technological innovation suddenly spurs economic growth and therefore GDP. So, what is the next big thing? Is it green? Is it hi-tech? Is it a new social medium? So, what is taking so long? Are anti-growth, government policies somehow impeding innovation as some argue? Yes, and no, but mostly no. Remember, the economy is growing, albeit not fast enough to curb the unemployment rate (controlling for labor force participation rate), but it is growing. The problem is how the economy is growing, not if it is growing. Companies are still hiring. But, whom are they hiring?
					</p>
					<br><br><h2> The Tacit Toiler</H2><br>
					<p>
					To understand hiring practices, let us first define some terms. In this article, I will refer to two types of information workers: tacit workers and explicit workers. Tacit knowledge, broadly speaking, refers to a set of skills that are highly social, organizationally specific, and difficult to train. Tacit workers understand people, products, organizational dynamics (beyond just the org-chart), and are highly emotionally attuned. Explicit knowledge, by contrast, is domain specific, highly technical, easy to teach (although, not always easy to learn), and organizationally transferable. Explicit workers are the statisticians, attorneys, accountants, and niche engineers. Any company needs both tacit and explicit knowledge. Innovation requires harnessing explicit knowledge, transforming it into tacit knowledge, and selling it. Pharmaceuticals, for example (and I am oversimplifying), hire bio-chemists with an explicit understanding of chemistry to develop a drug, which later becomes the intellectual property that the pharmaceutical sells. This is innovation. Great, so what is the problem?
					</p>
					<p>
					Invaluable to any organization is the explicit knowledge required to innovate, and produce, but not sell, goods. Sales are reserved for the tacit knowledge workers. So far, pretty basic. So what happened between 2000 and 2011 that so stifled the rate of technological innovation? The answer: the Internet. Faster, cheaper, communication media greatly accelerated the rate of innovation worldwide. Suddenly workers around the world could develop your software applications, manage your payroll, manufacture your drugs, or read your X-rays, all at a fraction of the cost, pre-Internet. Stated in economic jargon, supply increased, and so did demand (but not as much as supply), and the value (measured as price, or wage rate) for explicit knowledge greatly decreased in the United States. Suddenly, software engineers, chemists, accountants, and other explicit knowledge workers were greatly devalued. The U.S. core competency (or comparative advantage) shifted from advancing technological innovation to hiring and promoting physical presence. Where the foreign workforce, by definition, cannot compete against Americans is on the basis of physical presence. All workers that are currently in the United States, in at least physical presence, have the upper hand against their offshore counterparts. Macro-economically speaking, it does not even matter if American workers are more productive, or more innovative, than their offshore counterparts; the opportunity cost of being physically present is much too high to focus resources on technological innovation.
					</p>
					<p>
					By mid-decade 2000, American hiring managers decided if they were to employ headcount, the new hire would not only be physically present, but also be the best physical presence money could buy. No longer was looking good on paper a necessary and sufficient hiring criterion. Hirees now needed to look good in person, communicate well (to the point of understanding the most nuanced parts of language - English, of course - down to inflection), network well, and, of course, understand <i>the business</i>, not necessarily business, but <i>the business</i>. So, what form of knowledge workers were these highly social new hires? Tacit, of course. Not only that, tacit workers are compensated, in the form of equity, commission, and salary, relative to education, much more handsomely than the explicit knowledge workers. It  is as simple as supply and demand. Compounding the tacit worker hiring bias: tacit workers hire from their network, quite often, other tacit workers.
					</p>
					<p>
					But what about explicit knowledge? Surely, companies still hire explicit knowledge workers? Well, yes. But, companies do not employ the explicit workers, and certainly not at the same rate as their tacit worker counterparts. Quite often, the explicit workers are hired as consultants (1099), or even yet - contractors (w2). The difficulty here is the tacit workforce does not solely innovate. Innovation requires input from the explicit workforce. Worse still, the communication costs of strictly, outsourcing explicit knowledge workers can have severe, adverse, macro-economic consequences.
					</p>
					<br><br><h2> Banking on the Past</h2><br>
					<p>
					Take Financial Institutions: structurally hierarchical organizations, where management hire analysts to process vast amounts of data required to manage portfolios and optimize risk policies, and data processing and statistical modeling are mostly performed by a third party, contract W2 workers, who are absorbed into the system and treated as temporary employees. With few exceptions, corporate policy prevents hiring consultants on a Corp-to-Corp basis. The reasons for this, perhaps, are prejudicial and ironic for companies that espouse ethnic diversity at every corner! Many Indian programmers have circumvented the H1B Visa restrictions through the use of an LLC. Consequently, banks have updated vendor policy guidelines to reduce, significantly, if not altogether eliminate, Corp-to-Corp "hiring" engagements.
					</p>
					<p>
					Since many banks effectively have hiring freezes, the workaround is to hire temporary workers to process data and build analytical models. Temporary workers can only remain engaged for a maximum of 18 months due to government restrictions on contract employment, since the contractors are neither provided benefits nor an equity stake. Very often, there is a revolving door of analysts entering and exiting these companies, requiring firms to constantly need to train temporary workers.
					</p>
					<p>
					While many banks are able to attract academically talented individuals, transforming their talent into productive output is quite challenging. For example, I previously consulted for an analytics group that employed six doctoral graduates who had very strong explicit understanding of both statistics and economics, but all of whom were contingent labor. The analysts, when compared to the firm's management, proportionally lacked a solid understanding of the business, and consequently the data. Moreover, the firm as a whole continually produced sets of imperfect models and erroneous insights to which analysts and (less-than technical) managers were oblivious. Further inefficient, is the need for management to spend hours of otherwise productive work-time to train temporary workers and then later retain their replacements. Consequently, the company is unable to realize, fully, economies of time, while economies of scale are realized with almost zero marginal benefit at this point. Technology companies when compared to financial services companies, are far more competitive along the lines of economies of time, if for no other reason due to the advent of object oriented programming. While the comparison might seem tenuous at best, many bankers are trained as computer scientists, mathematicians, or engineers and can - if not readily - eventually find employment at a technology company. Nothing is inherently wrong with sub-prime mortgages, but if the risk is mis-allocated (mispriced), there is a huge problem.
					</p>
					<p>
					Aside from different scales of inefficiency, banks seem to attract an adverse selection of otherwise explicit knowledge workers. As the economy improves, labor supply decreases; continued hiring restrictions will only further decrease the stock of explicit knowledge among bank hires, and future hires will possess even less explicit knowledge than the current employee-base, ceteris paribus. Since the contract employees enjoy a limited tenure and lack equity, banks are also presented with a moral hazard. It is difficult to estimate the overall labor productivity (past five years) at these institutions, partially because the reported numbers are conflated as they have hired so many temporary workers. But, the trend cannot be positive given the disparity between tacit and explicit knowledge transfer and the inherent inefficiencies.
					</p>
					<br><br><h2> Inno-Bubbles </h2><br>
					<p>
					Of course, the Internet has had, and will continue to have, wondrous effects on the rate of technological innovation. But, at its core, the Internet is simply a communication medium; ultimately the people communicating - or some fraction of them - are the actual innovators. Up until this point, we have discussed the Internet's dampening influence on the U.S. rate of technological innovation. Perhaps the latest impact of the Internet in terms of innovation is its effect on the capital requirements for innovation. Pre-Internet, companies required huge sums of capital to produce innovative goods, usually acquired by loan or investment from banks or venture funds. Now, with the advent of the Internet, starting a business, and creating a product or service offering has never been faster, cheaper, or more demographically inclusive. Technology firms, for example, no longer need large capital requirements for land or capital equipment, and what labor is required is increasingly productive. Coupled with poor incentives, limited job-growth potential, explicit knowledge workers are starting their own firms. And, they are doing it with just a laptop and an Internet connection! But, what's more, they are hiring tacit knowledge workers. Meanwhile, the large, old-world, capital-intensive companies run by tacit workers hire (albeit on contract, or in some very limited capacity) explicit workers. This is what I call the tacit flip. Instead of the tacit workers hiring the explicit workers the opposite trend is in effect.
					</p>
					<p>
					For the United States to again dominate the innovation landscape, mature businesses will need to hire explicit knowledge workers to develop new, competitive, intellectual property, and employ tacit knowledge workers to market innovations and establish profitable relationships. Further, and perhaps more importantly, bridging the gap between tacit and explicit knowledge workers is required for both firms and employees to retain any modicum of competitive advantage. You cannot have an entire economy of socialites sustaining 2%+, annual, GDP growth. Similarly, you cannot have an entire economy of number crunching geeks running regressions for endless, self-indulgence.
					</p>
					<br><br><h2>Closing The Innovation Gap</h2>
					<p>
					So, how do we bridge the gap between tacit and explicit knowledge? To begin, companies need to harness and codify tacit knowledge in a way that is first: documented, second: transferable, and third: monetizable.  Collectively, tacit knowledge becomes sufficiently obvious due to repetition and time that an individual member of the collective can articulate discursively what is known tacitly. You can see, then, why hiring individuals to build a corpus of tacit knowledge is for many firms very valuable. For one, it is hard for any firm to hire the right fit, but if that were not bad enough, hiring individuals to build a corpus of tacit knowledge must be an incredible lengthy, and drudgerous process, not to mention unscalable.  Here lies the benefit of Machine Learning.  The ability to use mathematical algorithms to infer tacit knowledge, codify it, and create actionable intelligence is no longer reserved for science fiction. Imagine a Brick and Mortar Store.  There exists some un-codified knowledge about shopping behavior (certain behavioral patterns seem to result in sales, while others do not). The business hypothesizes that behavioral patterns predict shopping propensity, and begin to gather data on shopper behaviors to see if they can find a correlation. The data are used to train models that can predict, precisely, given a set of consumer behavioral attributes, the probability of a sale. Not only this, but also over time, the models can learn (by replacing prior probabilities with posterior probabilities) and improve their predictive performance.
					</p>
					<p>
					Here, the firm was able to codify the tacit knowledge, as the regression models know exactly which behavioral attributes are most predictive of sales, by how much each attribute influences sales, and their respective statistical significance.  The firm can take immediate action as a result of this intelligence. Customers can be categorized by expected value (purchase propensity * sale value), and resources can be allocated efficiently to meet customer demands.    In a way, then, tacit knowledge has been transformed into explicit knowledge!
					</p>
					<p>
					Conversely, how do we codify explicit knowledge?  One way to achieve this requires leveraging data for simulation purposes, and equip the tacit workforce with the ability to solve complex business problems usually reserved for the business intelligence departments. Instead of marketing, or finance departments requiring data pulls and ad-hoc reports to "answer" immediate business questions, business intelligence departments should gather as much tacit knowledge from the existing workforce and design software simulations that "mimic" the underlying market dynamics that achieve revenues and incur losses. Currently, firms use reporting dashboards to answer business metric questions, and employ analysts to generate ad-hoc reports to "fill in the gaps" where reporting dashboard are not capturing data. But this means of analytics is neither scalable nor particularly insightful. And worse, there is a "silo effect" where tacit and explicit knowledge, both of which are required to provide business intelligence, are maintained by separate corporate entities. The explicit knowledge required to analyze data is reserved for business intelligence units, while the tacit knowledge required provide context to the analyses is specific to the tacit knowledge workers. Simulations retain and transfer tacit knowledge, while allowing tacit workers to solve complex problems usually reserved for explicit knowledge workers.
					</p>
					<br><br><h2>Forget Business Intelligence. We Live in a Multivarariate World</h2>
					<p>
					How can organizations more effectively communicate tacit knowledge through to the lowest levels of an organizational chart? I don't think reports and dashboards communicate tacit knowledge, at least not intrinsically. You need to understand the business context to correctly interpret business reports and analytical dashboards. Improved data visualization helps communicate information more efficiently, but again their effectiveness is limited to the overall business context. The problem remains - the workforce needs to understand the business.
					</p>
					<p>
					Where simulations differ from models and reports is their ability to foster interactive learning. In fact, it's hard to imagine how you communicate tacit knowledge without some level of interaction, either human or otherwise. Expanding business analytics to include business simulations can ultimately promote the transfer and communication of tacit knowledge. Simulations enable your workforce to explore dynamic variables of a model, and answer <i>what-if</i> questions, not only "what happened" questions. Through this process management can optimize business policies and understand various n'th order effects, while lower-level actors (the analysts) can interactively understand the data in such a way that complex calculations facilitate tacit knowledge transfer.
					</p>
					<br><br><h2>Market. Structure. Conduct. Performance.</h2>
					<p>
					Still, several questions remain. First, what is the optimal mix of tacit vs. explicit knowledge workers at an organization to ensure a profit-maximizing level of innovation? Second, who will rise to the management ranks of an organization based on current trajectories and organizational dynamics? Third, to optimally innovate, what types of firms are best suited for tacit or explicit knowledge workers? Fourth do the success of tacit or explicit workers vary with firm size or structure? The most obvious point to this end is that if any one part of the workforce has the exclusive responsibility for innovation, then the U.S. workforce will struggle to remain competitive in years to come. Among the most innovative firms are those hiring both explicit and tacit knowledge workers, each equipped with the requisite skills to introduce new, often disruptive, technologies. One heuristic describing the respective roles of the tacit and explicit knowledge workers as it relates to innovation: the tacit knowledge worker answers <i>why</i>, whereas the explicit knowledge workers answers <i>how</i>. <b>What does the market need</b> and <b> how do we build it</b>  are two important questions seeding the early stages of innovation. Ultimately, the optimal mix of tacit and explicit knowledge workers, depends on market structure and firm conduct. Certain industries and firm sizes are better served hiring more tacit knowledge worker while other firms are better served hiring more explicit knowledge works. Technology companies, for example, particularly in early stages, need more explicit knowledge workers than tacit. Advertising agencies, by contrast, are better served by tacit knowledge workers. Still yet: perhaps the "optimal" mix of tacit to explicit knowledge workers is better asked in terms of worker inclination, as opposed to worker composition. Instead of hiring, say, x% pure tacit workers and y% pure explicit knowledge worker, the optimal mix might just require firms hiring explicit workers with a tacit inclination and tacit workers with an explicit inclination.  The combined effect of hiring a <i>tacitly-inclined</i> explicit worker, and vice versa, an <i>explicitly-inclined</i> tacit worker, on a unit basis, might more optimally yield a problem solving workforce with more innovative solutions than hiring just hiring one type of knowledge worker, either solely tacit or solely explicit.  The secondary effect of this type of hiring process will likely eliminate various communication gaps and silo effects. Meanwhile, managers will need to not just understand <i>the business</i> but, more generally, business. Forecasting, inventory optimization, pricing, marketing analytics, etc. are all components of the overall skillset required of managers to both compete for profit and position. Finally, both explicit and tacit knowledge workers (individual contributors and management, alike) will need to harness systems thinking skills. Explicit knowledge workers will need to, for obvious reasons, create a mental or computational model of how various constituents of the larger (be it analytical, software, information, manufacturing) system interact with each other and over time. Meanwhile, tacit workers - and management, specifically - will need to embrace systems thinking to solve problems relating to pricing, inventory optimization, quality control, demand forecasting, personnel management, etc. The ever-evolving, complex systems on which we depend for new products and services, employment and income, innovations and modernization require organizational structures that employ systems thinking and a systems view, especially if we are to adapt to volatile economic conditions and continue our path of technological innovation.
					</p>
					<p>
					While recent years have seen a surge of demand for tacit workers in the United States, the trend, absent explicit worker counterparts, is unsustainable at best. Firms require revenues, capital deepening, and future innovations to remain competitive for the long run. For the U.S. economy to return to full employment, deep cultural changes must first take place in the workplace, allowing firms to again innovate internally and create new markets for products and services, which will in turn spur labor demand.
